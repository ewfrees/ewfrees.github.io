## Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal
The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

# Development Site

This is the landing page where you can access recent developments in the *Loss Data Analytics* texts. A more stable version, that is being updated less frequently, is available at our 'production' [Open Actuarial Textbooks Landing Site](https://openacttexts.github.io/). You can also access pdf and epub (current and older) versions of the text in our [Offline versions of the text](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/DownloadOffline.html).

# Loss Data Analytics

**Book Description** - *Loss Data Analytics* will be an interactive, online, freely available text.

We are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).

# R Codes for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. To get an idea of what the files will generate for users, see the [Online Version from R Code Support](https://ewfrees.github.io/LDARcode/index.html).

Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LDARCode).

# Interactive Features of Loss Data Analytics

[This repository](https://ewfrees.github.io/InteractiveLDA/index.html) describes the interactive features being developed for *Loss Data Analytics*.

# Overheads for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides chapter summaries in the form of overheads to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. Overheads in .pdf format and source code is available at a development [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsOverheads).

# Translation Demonstration

* Here is a [version of the book](https://alyaanuval.github.io/LDATranslate/C-Intro.html#S:Intro) where we translated a section from English to Malay. 
* The instructions for doing the translation are at a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alyaanuval/LDATranslate). 

# Life Contingencies / Actuarial Mathematics

The initial focus of the project is on *Loss Data Analytics* although we hope to expand to other actuarial texts. In that spirit, we organize several sets of notes for *Life Contingencies*, also known as *Actuarial Mathematics* and *Long Term Actuarial Mathematics*. See the development [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LifeCon).
